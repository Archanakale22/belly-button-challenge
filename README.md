# belly-button-challenge
The goal is to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which contains information about the microbial species (OTUs) present in human navels. The dataset reveals that a small number of microbial species are prevalent in over 70% of individuals, while others are relatively rare. The process involves data preparation, dashboard design, visualization using libraries like Plotly or Matplotlib, implementing interactivity features, deploying the dashboard, and providing clear documentation for users. This project aims to showcase the diversity of microbial life and enable users to dynamically explore the dataset's insights.
